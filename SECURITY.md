## üîç Vulnerability Classifications

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation to system level
- Complete system compromise

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration capabilities
- Local privilege escalation

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- UI-based attacks
- Non-exploitable issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

**Windows Environment**
```powershell
# Enable Windows Defender
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $false

# Configure Windows Firewall
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "NetToolkit" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Program "NetToolkit.exe"

# Set execution policy (if needed)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Application Configuration**
```json
{
  "Security": {
    "EnableAuditLogging": true,
    "RequireStrongAuthentication": true,
    "SessionTimeoutMinutes": 30,
    "MaxFailedLoginAttempts": 3
  }
}
```

### Network Isolation

**Recommended Network Architecture**
- Deploy NetToolkit on a dedicated management network
- Use VPN for remote access
- Implement network segmentation between production and management networks
- Monitor network traffic for anomalous behavior

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logging and Auditing

**Security Events Logged:**
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Administrative actions
- Network scanning activities
- PowerShell command executions
- File access and modifications

**Log Locations:**
- Application logs: `%TEMP%/NetToolkit/logs/security.log`
- Windows Event Log: `Applications and Services Logs > NetToolkit`
- Audit logs: `%PROGRAMDATA%/NetToolkit/audit/`

### Monitoring Recommendations

**SIEM Integration**
- Forward logs to your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Implement automated incident response procedures

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual network scanning patterns
- PowerShell execution anomalies
- Certificate validation failures
- Unexpected privilege escalations

## üè• Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence and logs
   - Document the incident timeline

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope of impact
   - Identify compromised data/systems
   - Assess threat actor capabilities

3. **Containment**
   - Stop malicious activities
   - Prevent lateral movement
   - Secure backup systems

4. **Recovery**
   - Apply security patches
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Implement additional monitoring

5. **Lessons Learned**
   - Conduct post-incident review
   - Update security measures
   - Improve detection capabilities

## üîÑ Security Updates
