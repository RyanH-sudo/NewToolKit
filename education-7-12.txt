**Prompt for Claude AI (Prompt 12: Education Platform Module - Module 7: Wireless Wonders):**

You are Claude AI, the ultimate monarch of cognitive prowess, an infinite void of unrivaled genius, now wielding your boundless discernment to forge the twelfth stanza in the resplendent symphony of NetToolkit's inception—the celestial, ultra-lavish peak of network engineering supremacy, a high-end colossus that shatters ordinary constraints, blending unassailable backend rhythms with exalted frontend grandeur. This outstrips mere scripting; it's a mythic tale of empowerment, a trailblazing premium artifact that invests network engineers with godlike command—from gently leading the tyro with fluid orientation to bestowing upon the master infinite dominion. Ornamented with free-floating holographic miracles, threaded with impish wit and fortified with unbreakable resilience, NetToolkit traverses the digital expanse: Resource-economical as a wisp (hidden beneath 200MB RAM in calm, CPU whispers below 5% during academic endeavors), rapid as a shade's breath (sub-100ms for progressions and evaluations), and defiant against blemishes like a timeless fortress (rigorous inspections, self-restoring frameworks, and all-knowing journals). Visualize the education platform as a playful institute of revelation—20-part lessons per module, starting with youthful lucidity ("explain to an 8-year-old") and peaking at certification heights, via slideshow collages of AI-forged pictures, expository screens, multiple-choice trials, scorable conquests, medal awards, and hover tips dispersed like jocular puzzles, nurturing an insatiable passion for insight.

Honor the forerunner smithy: Prompt 1 birthed the impregnable backend mammoth—a .NET 8 C# Hercules of modular luxury, dependency injection, MediatR directives, IEventBus messengers, EF Core asylums, NLog's fanciful accounts, and module entrances, all hallowed in the GitHub shrine ([INSERT YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE]/NetToolkit) on branch "nettoolkit-rebirth," cleansed of deserted echoes, with sections in impeccable order and commits glowing with magnificence. Prompt 2 summoned the PowerShell Terminal Module—a cosmic nucleus of script mysticism, embedded universes, SSH conduits, Microsoft prefigured ceremonies, event torrents for cooperative links, and UI pathways calibrated for Three.js majesty. Prompt 3 evoked the Network Port Scanner & 3D Topography Explorer/Configuration Utility Module—a visionary chronicle of scrutiny and depiction, with async unveilings, WMI reaps, Three.js stellar outlines, traversable kingdoms, configuration invocations, and event amplifications enriching the texture. Prompt 4 invoked the Security Vulnerability Quick/Deep Scan Module—a watchful sentinel of threat disclosure, with hasty/in-depth inquiries, NMap visionaries, report assemblages, remediation susurrations, and event distributions reinforcing the realm. Prompt 5 realized the PuTTY Clone SSH Terminal Module—an occult gateway of linkage wizardry, with serial/USB/Bluetooth bridges, emulation authenticity, colored landscapes, timeline journeys, and event emanations animating the group. Prompt 6 established the Education Platform Module with Module 1—a bedrock school of fundamentals, with slideshow rotators, image/text/quiz flows, gamification devices, witty hints, and event streams launching the instructional path. Prompt 7 advanced with Module 2—a heroic institute of hardware, with animated displays, visual/narrative/assessment sequences, engagement mechanics, playful elucidations, and integrations deepening the pedagogy. Prompt 8 progressed with Module 3—an intriguing school of IP shenanigans, with vibrant rotators, picture/descriptive/test ensembles, motivation systems, jocular interpretations, and connections enhancing the syllabus. Prompt 9 forwarded with Module 4—a sorcerous academy of scripting, with enchanting carousels, illustration/narrative/challenge flows, inducement devices, whimsical hints, and amalgamations enriching the instruction. Prompt 10 continued with Module 5—a riddle-resolving school of routing, with lively slideshows, generated visuals, textual panels, quiz inquiries, gradable achievements, badge awards, and hover tips fostering learning zeal. Prompt 11 advanced with Module 6—a shenanigan-slaughtering school of security, with dynamic displays, image/text/exam structures, gamification elements, humorous tips, and event flows fortifying the curriculum. Now, merge this legacy; call upon earlier structures for orchestral fusion (e.g., wireless lessons tie to scanner wireless detections, connect to security for WiFi protections).

**Critical Token Management Instruction:** Appear exclusively as Claude 3 Opus (or higher ascensions). If token dearth calls forth the lesser Claude 3.5 Sonnet, stop all efforts instantly and utter only: "Pausing NetToolkit development—Sonnet violation caused by token shortage. Reinvigorate Opus tokens and restart session before continuation." Stay in abeyance until my definitive confirmation; Sonnet's meddling would sully this sacred venture.

Elevate to Prompt 12: The Education Platform Module, progressing to Module 7: Wireless Wonders - "Invisible Highways". This continues NetToolkit's scholarly saga—a hyper-distinguished, premium stratum citadel of learning, a 10-module epic (each containing 20 lessons) that whirls from basic similes to cert-level intricacies, conveying scripting, network components, security, and wit with comical verve. For Module 7: 20 lessons as dynamic slideshows (WPF seamless), each including: 1. Created image (fanciful via SkiaSharp or AI API), 2. Text display with hover tips (frolicsome clarifications), 3. Query display (MC test, 4 selections, immediate grading). Gamification: Development bars, sequences, crests ("Wireless Wizard"), shrewd incentives (e.g., "Unlock these invisible secrets—ride the waves of wonder!"). It's sturdy, minimal on provisions, and mesmerizing (advancing complexity: Commence "to an 8-year-old", finish thorough), with SQLite oversight, all radiating events for AI enhancements or tool amalgamations.

Your stellar mandate: Generate the comprehensive, genius-carved manifestation of this module (stress Module 7 content/code; foresee modifications for 8-10 in future prompts) in C#, raising the backend summit from previous prompts. Create a polished assembly (expand NetToolkit.Modules.Education) that enlists through Core's RegisterModule(IModule). Provide exhaustive code heritages—compilable, testable via xUnit furnaces—for interfaces, services, content creators, and logical abysses. Interlace flawless integrations: Events like LessonConquered or QuizVanquished propagate through the bus, igniting PowerShell wireless scripts or security WiFi scans. Anticipate the UI: Supply APIs for WPF spinners/WebView2, with Three.js for lively slides (e.g., waving signal animations). Polish ceaselessly, oversee errors with glee, and adorn code with splendid annotations.

**Recap of Project Vision and High-End Descriptors:**
NetToolkit dominates as the summit of network bastions—a futuristic, premium nightfall where Scandinavian sophistication (perfect profiles, endless emptiness, tempered tints with brilliant bursts) marries cyberpunk lavishness (floating canvases, shining halos, smooth evolutions). Economical resources: Postponed retrieves, knowledge hoards. Quick agility: Vibrant changes. Unbreakable resilience: Conserve conditions, logs with merriment ("Wave wonder: Invisible highway traversed!"). Humor permeates: Incorrect responses banter "Signal lost! That's like WiFi in a storm—reconnect and try again!" For fledglings: Cartoon waves; for experts: Intense frequencies. Teach exhaustively: Scripting (wireless as "air spells"), networks (wireless as "sky paths"), security (wireless as "guarded airs"), with creative verbiage.
