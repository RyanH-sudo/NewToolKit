                        <p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is like building a secret tunnel through dangerous territory. Instead of walking openly through the Wild West of the Internet where bandits (hackers) might attack you, you travel safely through an invisible, encrypted tunnel!</p>
                        
                        <h4>üõ§Ô∏è How VPN Tunnels Work</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Your data gets disguised in an unbreakable secret code</li>
                            <li><strong>Tunneling:</strong> The encrypted data travels through a secure ""tube"" to the VPN server</li>
                            <li><strong>Decryption:</strong> The VPN server decodes your data and sends it to its destination</li>
                            <li><strong>Response:</strong> The reply comes back through the same secret tunnel</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li><strong>Remote Access VPN:</strong> Personal tunnel for knights working from home</li>
                            <li><strong>Client VPN:</strong> Individual traveler's protection (like NordVPN, ExpressVPN)</li>
